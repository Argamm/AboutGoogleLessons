    <string name="bio">Flowers are blooming brighter than ever before. The sun has begun peeking out of the clouds, and the sweetest breeze wafts around me now that I have you in my life. Nature adores you as much as I do.

Dearest love of mine, there is not a star in the expanse of the universe that could shine as bright as you do. I hope that you have the best possible day and the sweetest dreams tonight.
    There are not enough words in the English language to describe how beautiful you are. I could learn every language on Earth and still be at a loss for words trying to say how much I love you.

To me, you are sublime. You are one hundred orchestras playing the most beautiful symphonies at once.
